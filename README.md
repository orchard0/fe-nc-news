# News website:

A website that lists articles by topic. Each article has voting and commenting functionality.

It's hosted [here](https://northcoders-news-frontend.vercel.app/). (You may have to wait a few minutes whilst the backend fires up before you see the content.)

Backend api is hosted [here](https://northcoders-news-backend.vercel.app/api) and the repo is [here](https://github.com/orchard0/northcoders-news-backend).
